# Markov-Chain-Simulator
Create Markov chains by adding states and links. Solve ergodic and absorbing chains analytically or by simulation.  

#Dependencies
scipy 
numpy

#Instructions
To use this tool, clone the repository and build Markov Chains in the fashion of test1.py, test2.py, and test3.py.

#Disclaimer
It is the user's responsibility to feed appropriate probability vectors.  Only minimal error testing is conducted.
Please double check your input vectors.
